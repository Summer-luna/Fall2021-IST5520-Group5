They have collected some data on their customers in the hopes of gaining insight into the best path forward with their marketing, however they are unable to make heads or tails of the raw data.  They have approached our group with a proposal to analyze their data and provide recommendations for future marketing campaigns.\n",

The end result should increase the effectiveness of the advertisement campaigns resulting in an increase of sales.  The goal of this project is to attempt to answer some key questions regarding future advertisements (these may change as the project develops):\n",
