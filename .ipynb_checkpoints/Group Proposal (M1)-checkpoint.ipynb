    "\n",
    "Airbnb would like to increase its user base by identifying potential hosts to convince them to use their property as a rental location. The company has already gathered a large amount of data on its current listings and has come to our group to analyze the given data. They would like to provide the hosts with suggestions for their property descriptions, which amenities to offer, etc., and use these values to predict the ratings, listing prices, booking percentage of available dates, and more. To pilot this idea, the company would like to focus on one city in the United States before rolling this predictive model out to other locations. The dataset to be used in this analysis will be from Inside Airbnb, specifically the Chicago, Illinois datasets. The company would like to use this analysis to determine the ideal property type, location, and amenities to look for potential rental locations, and then predict how the host’s actions (descriptions, response rate, etc.) would affect the listing’s potential."

    "The hosts want to lease their properties on Airbnb, but they are not sure what prices they should put for their new properties(different types). So they want to find a model to predict the Airbnb rental trend next year. As the economy grows every year, Airbnb is looking for a new price range for their new properties. The hosts can use this price reference to determine whether they should list their properties on Airbnb. Airbnb can use this model to make their marketing plan to recruit their target partners(hosts). \n",

Therefore, customers are looking for reliable feedback and rating for a property that they are willing to pay the rent for. Airbnb uses the model to offer the customers the right properties and right pricing that they are looking for. Based on the feedback that the customer puts after visiting a particular property, makes the basis of judgment for all the future customers who wish to rent the property. \n",
